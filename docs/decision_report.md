# FoodFast Platform - Feature Decision Report

## Feature 1: Customer Account Management

### Pattern Chosen
**Synchronous REST API over HTTP/HTTPS**

### Reasoning

#### 1. Business Requirement Analysis
- Customers must register, login, update profile information, and manage payment methods.
- Users expect **immediate confirmation** when they login or update their profile.
- Payment information must be **secure and reliable**.
- The system should work reliably **even with poor mobile connectivity**.

#### 2. Technical Considerations
- Synchronous REST API provides **instant request/response**, ideal for login, registration, and profile updates.
- Supports **secure HTTPS connections** for sensitive data such as passwords and payment methods.
- Compatible with **PostgreSQL** and easily integrated with Flask.
- Works well under moderate concurrent load (10,000 users across 5 cities is manageable for this feature).

#### 3. User Experience Impact
- Users receive **immediate feedback** after actions (register, login, update).
- Reduces confusion and increases trust in the platform.
- Provides predictable behavior, important for critical operations like payment management.

#### 4. Scalability Factors
- Synchronous REST scales well for **moderate load**.
- Can be enhanced later with **load balancing** or **horizontal scaling** if user base grows.
- Simple architecture ensures easy maintenance and debugging.

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Asynchronous / Event-driven**
   - Pros: Decouples frontend and backend, good for high load.
   - Cons: Responses may be delayed, unacceptable for login/profile updates.
   - **Rejected** because immediate confirmation is critical.

2. **WebSockets**
   - Pros: Real-time bi-directional communication.
   - Cons: Overkill for simple CRUD operations; adds complexity.
   - **Rejected** due to unnecessary complexity.

### Trade-offs Accepted
- Higher server load compared to asynchronous handling, but acceptable due to **critical nature**.
- Chose simplicity and reliability over real-time streaming capabilities.

## Feature 2: Order Tracking for Customers

### Pattern Chosen
**Long Polling**

### Reasoning

#### 1. Business Requirement Analysis
- Customers need to track orders from "Confirmed → Preparing → Ready → Picked up → Delivered".
- Updates should **feel real-time** but do not need to be instantaneous.
- Mobile app should **conserve battery life**.
- System must handle **1,000+ concurrent users** during peak hours.

#### 2. Technical Considerations
- Long Polling allows the server to **hold a request open** until the status changes or a timeout occurs (e.g., 60 seconds).
- Reduces unnecessary frequent polling, conserving **server resources** and **mobile battery**.
- Compatible with Flask and PostgreSQL.
- Easy to implement and maintain with existing REST infrastructure.

#### 3. User Experience Impact
- Users see near-real-time updates without needing WebSockets.
- Feedback is timely and predictable.
- Conserves battery and network usage on mobile devices.

#### 4. Scalability Factors
- Long Polling scales better than naive short-polling (30s-2min) for thousands of concurrent users.
- Can be enhanced later with **event-driven architecture** or **WebSockets** if ultra-low latency is required.

### Alternatives Considered
1. **WebSockets**
   - Pros: True real-time updates.
   - Cons: More complex, higher resource consumption, not needed for 30s-2min update intervals.
   - **Rejected** due to unnecessary complexity and battery/network impact.

2. **Short Polling**
   - Pros: Simple to implement.
   - Cons: Frequent requests increase server load and battery consumption.
   - **Rejected** because long polling is more efficient.

### Trade-offs Accepted
- Slight delay in updates (up to 60 seconds) is acceptable for user experience.
- Simplicity and battery/network efficiency prioritized over true real-time delivery.

## Feature 3: Driver Location Updates

### Pattern Chosen
**WebSockets (Flask-SocketIO)**

### Reasoning

#### 1. Business Requirement Analysis
- Customers want to see their delivery driver’s location **in real-time** on a map during delivery.
- Location updates occur every **10–15 seconds**.
- Only the customer who placed the order should see the driver’s location.
- Updates must appear **smooth** and work reliably on **mobile networks**.
- Feature is active for **30–45 minutes** per delivery.

#### 2. Technical Considerations
- WebSockets enable **bi-directional, low-latency communication**, ideal for location streaming.
- Efficient for frequent updates without creating excessive HTTP requests.
- Compatible with Flask using **Flask-SocketIO** and can run with **eventlet** for concurrency.
- Only authorized users join specific “rooms” corresponding to their order, ensuring privacy.

#### 3. User Experience Impact
- Driver movement appears **smooth** on the customer’s map.
- Near-instant updates improve trust and engagement.
- Reduces battery and data consumption compared to frequent HTTP polling.

#### 4. Scalability Factors
- WebSockets handle multiple simultaneous connections efficiently.
- Rooms isolate users by order, preventing unnecessary broadcasts.
- Can scale horizontally with **multiple SocketIO workers** if delivery volume increases.

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Long Polling**
   - Pros: Easy to implement.
   - Cons: High latency and inefficient for updates every 10–15 seconds.
   - **Rejected** due to poor UX for near-real-time tracking.

2. **Short Polling**
   - Pros: Simple, no WebSocket dependencies.
   - Cons: Constant HTTP requests overload server and mobile devices.
   - **Rejected** for performance reasons.

### Trade-offs Accepted
- Slightly higher server complexity due to WebSocket setup.
- Improved user experience justifies added infrastructure complexity.
- Requires **Flask-SocketIO** and **eventlet** or **gevent** for concurrency.

## Feature 4: Restaurant Order Notifications

### Pattern Chosen

**WebSockets (Flask-SocketIO)**

### Reasoning

#### 1. Business Requirement Analysis

* Restaurants must be notified of **new orders within 5 seconds**.
* Multiple staff members may be logged into the restaurant dashboard simultaneously.
* Orders must appear **automatically**—no page refresh required.
* During peak hours, restaurants may receive **1–2 orders per minute**, and **missed orders directly affect revenue**.

#### 2. Technical Considerations

* **WebSockets** provide **bi-directional, real-time communication**, ideal for instant order delivery.
* Flask-SocketIO with **eventlet** supports efficient concurrent connections and “room” concepts, so each restaurant can have a dedicated room for all staff sessions.
* The server can emit a `new_order` event to the restaurant’s room as soon as an order is created, ensuring sub-second latency.
* Integrates cleanly with the existing PostgreSQL database and Flask application.

#### 3. User Experience Impact

* Restaurant staff see new orders **immediately** without reloading the dashboard.
* Multiple staff members stay **in sync** because all receive the same real-time event.
* Reliable instant notifications reduce the chance of **missed or delayed orders**, improving customer satisfaction.

#### 4. Scalability Factors

* WebSockets handle **many concurrent clients** efficiently.
* Using SocketIO “rooms” isolates notifications to specific restaurants, avoiding unnecessary broadcasts.
* Horizontal scaling is supported by deploying multiple SocketIO workers with a message broker (e.g., Redis) for pub/sub.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Long Polling**

   * Pros: Simpler to implement on top of REST.
   * Cons: Adds latency (seconds) and wastes resources during busy periods.
   * **Rejected** because the 5-second requirement demands near-instant delivery.

2. **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**

   * Pros: One-way real-time updates from server to client.
   * Cons: No built-in support for joining/leaving rooms and multi-staff synchronization is trickier.
   * **Rejected** in favor of SocketIO’s robust room and acknowledgement features.

### Trade-offs Accepted

* Slightly higher infrastructure complexity (maintaining persistent WebSocket connections).
* Requires a compatible async server (e.g., **eventlet** or **gevent**) in production.
* These trade-offs are justified to guarantee **sub-second, reliable order notifications**.
