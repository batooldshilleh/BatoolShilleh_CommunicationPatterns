* Users expect **immediate confirmation** when they login or update their profile.
* Payment information must be **secure and reliable**.
* The system should work reliably **even with poor mobile connectivity**.

#### 2. Technical Considerations

* Implemented using **Flask Blueprint** with synchronous REST endpoints:

  * `POST /api/auth/register` → Registers new users.
  * `POST /api/auth/login` → Handles login with immediate response.
  * `PUT /api/auth/update-profile/<user_id>` → Updates profile details.
* Interacts with **PostgreSQL** via SQLAlchemy ORM.
* Synchronous request/response ensures **instant feedback** for registration, login, and profile updates.
* Simple architecture allows **easy maintenance and debugging**.

#### 3. User Experience Impact

* Users receive **immediate confirmation** for all critical actions.
* Reduces confusion and increases trust in the platform.
* Predictable behavior ensures reliability during profile and authentication operations.

#### 4. Scalability Factors

* Scales well for **moderate load** (e.g., 10,000 users across 5 cities).
* Can be enhanced with **load balancing** or **horizontal scaling** if user base grows.
* Synchronous design keeps endpoints simple and maintainable.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Asynchronous / Event-driven**

   * Pros: Decouples frontend and backend, better for very high load.
   * Cons: Response delays are unacceptable for login and profile updates.
   * **Rejected** because immediate feedback is critical.

2. **WebSockets**

   * Pros: Real-time bi-directional communication.
   * Cons: Overkill for simple CRUD operations; adds unnecessary complexity.
   * **Rejected** in favor of REST for simplicity and reliability.

### Trade-offs Accepted

* Higher server load compared to asynchronous processing, but acceptable due to the **critical nature** of authentication and profile management.
* Chose **simplicity and reliability** over real-time streaming capabilities.

## Feature 2: Order Tracking for Customers

### Pattern Chosen

**Long Polling**

### Reasoning

#### 1. Business Requirement Analysis

* Customers need to track their orders from **Confirmed → Preparing → Ready → Picked up → Delivered**.
* Updates should **feel real-time** but do not need to be instantaneous.
* Mobile app should **conserve battery life**.
* System must handle **1,000+ concurrent users** during peak hours.

#### 2. Technical Considerations

* Implemented using **Flask REST endpoints** with **long polling**:

  * `GET /api/orders/<order_id>/status?last_status=<status>` → Holds request open up to 60 seconds until the order status changes.
  * `POST /api/orders` → Creates a new order and triggers notifications to restaurants.
  * `PUT /api/orders/<order_id>/status` → Updates order status in the database.
* Reduces unnecessary frequent polling, conserving **server resources** and **mobile battery**.
* Compatible with existing Flask/PostgreSQL infrastructure.
* Provides predictable response timing without the complexity of WebSockets.

#### 3. User Experience Impact

* Customers see **near-real-time order updates** without overwhelming the server.
* Status updates are timely and predictable.
* Conserves mobile battery and network usage.

#### 4. Scalability Factors

* Long polling scales better than short polling for thousands of concurrent users.
* Can be later enhanced with **event-driven architecture** or **WebSockets** if ultra-low latency is required.
* Keeps backend implementation simple and maintainable.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **WebSockets**

   * Pros: True real-time updates.
   * Cons: Higher resource consumption; unnecessary for 30–60 second update intervals.
   * **Rejected** to preserve battery and network efficiency.

2. **Short Polling**

   * Pros: Simple to implement.
   * Cons: Frequent requests increase server load and battery usage.
   * **Rejected** in favor of long polling for efficiency.

### Trade-offs Accepted

* Slight delay in status updates (up to 60 seconds) is acceptable.
* Chose **simplicity and battery/network efficiency** over instant real-time delivery.

* Location updates occur every **10–15 seconds**.
* Only the customer who placed the order should see the driver’s location.
* Updates must appear **smooth** and work reliably on **mobile networks**.
* Feature is active for **30–45 minutes** per delivery.

#### 2. Technical Considerations

* Implemented using **Flask-SocketIO** with WebSocket events:

  * `"join_order_room"` → Customer joins a private room for the order.
  * `"leave_order_room"` → Customer leaves the room when tracking ends.
  * `"update_driver_location"` → Driver broadcasts location updates to the corresponding room.
* WebSockets provide **low-latency, bi-directional communication**, efficient for frequent updates.
* Ensures **privacy** by isolating customers per order room.
* Compatible with Flask, SocketIO, and can scale with **eventlet/gevent workers**.

#### 3. User Experience Impact

* Driver movements appear **smooth and near-instant** on the customer’s map.
* Enhances trust and engagement by showing real-time location.
* Reduces battery and network usage compared to frequent HTTP polling.

#### 4. Scalability Factors

## Feature 4: Restaurant Order Notifications

### Pattern Chosen

**WebSockets (Flask-SocketIO)**

### Reasoning

#### 1. Business Requirement Analysis

* Restaurants must be notified of **new orders within 5 seconds**.
* Multiple staff members may be logged into the restaurant dashboard simultaneously.
* Orders must appear **automatically** without page refresh.
* During peak hours, restaurants may receive **1–2 orders per minute**, and **missed orders directly affect revenue**.

#### 2. Technical Considerations

* Implemented using **Flask-SocketIO**:

  * `"join_restaurant_room"` → Staff joins a private room for their restaurant.
  * `"leave_restaurant_room"` → Staff leaves the room when logged out.
  * `notify_new_order(order)` → Emits `new_order` event to all staff in the restaurant room.
* WebSockets provide **bi-directional, real-time communication**, ensuring sub-second delivery.
* Rooms isolate notifications to specific restaurants.
* Compatible with existing Flask/PostgreSQL infrastructure and scales with **eventlet/gevent workers**.

#### 3. User Experience Impact

* Multiple staff members stay **synchronized** as all receive the same real-time event.
* Reduces risk of missed or delayed orders.

#### 4. Scalability Factors

* WebSockets efficiently handle many concurrent staff clients.
* Rooms prevent unnecessary broadcasts to other restaurants.
* Horizontal scaling supported via multiple SocketIO workers and a message broker (e.g., Redis pub/sub).

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Long Polling**

   * Pros: Simple to implement on top of REST.
   * Cons: Adds latency (seconds) and wastes resources during busy periods.
   * **Rejected** because the 5-second delivery requirement demands near-instant notifications.

2. **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**

   * Pros: One-way real-time updates from server to client.
   * Cons: No built-in support for joining/leaving rooms and multi-staff synchronization is trickier.
   * **Rejected** in favor of SocketIO’s robust room and acknowledgment features.

### Trade-offs Accepted

* Slightly higher infrastructure complexity due to persistent WebSocket connections.
* Requires **async server** (eventlet or gevent) in production.
* These trade-offs are justified to guarantee **sub-second, reliable order notifications**.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Long Polling / Short Polling**

   * Pros: Simple to implement using HTTP endpoints.
   * Cons: Increased latency and higher server/network load for real-time messaging.
   * **Rejected** because instant, interactive messaging is required.

2. **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**

   * Pros: One-way updates from server to client.
   * Cons: Not suitable for bi-directional chat; cannot efficiently handle multiple agents sending messages.
   * **Rejected** due to lack of full duplex communication.

### Trade-offs Accepted

* Slightly higher server complexity due to persistent WebSocket connections.
* Requires async server (eventlet/gevent) in production.
* Chosen approach prioritizes **real-time, interactive user experience** over simplicity.

## Feature 6: System-Wide Announcements

### Pattern Chosen

**Asynchronous / Queue-Based Broadcast (Pub/Sub)**

### Reasoning

#### 1. Business Requirement Analysis

* Platform needs to send announcements to **thousands of users simultaneously**.
* Users should receive announcements while using the app, but delays of a few minutes are acceptable.
* Announcements are **not critical** and should not overwhelm the server during peak usage.
* Users may not be actively using the app when the announcement is sent.

#### 2. Technical Considerations

* Implemented using **Redis + RQ queue**:

  * `POST /api/announcements` → Creates an announcement and enqueues a job for broadcasting.
  * `GET /api/announcements` → Lists recent announcements.
* Queue workers (e.g., RQ workers) process announcements asynchronously, distributing messages without blocking the main server.
* Reduces server load and prevents spikes during high-traffic periods.
* Supports integration with mobile push notifications or WebSocket updates for active users.

#### 3. User Experience Impact

* Announcements may appear with minor delay (seconds to a few minutes) — acceptable for non-critical messages.
* Ensures platform stability while notifying most users reliably.
* Avoids degrading performance for other features.

#### 4. Scalability Factors

* Queue-based broadcasting scales horizontally with multiple workers.
* Redis supports pub/sub for efficiently delivering messages to active clients.
* System can handle thousands of announcements without overloading the main application server.

1. **WebSockets**

   * Pros: Real-time delivery to connected users.
   * Cons: Requires all users to maintain persistent connections; unnecessary for non-critical announcements.
   * **Rejected** due to complexity and server load.

2. **Long Polling / Short Polling**

   * Pros: Simple to implement.
   * Cons: Inefficient for system-wide broadcasts to thousands of users.
   * **Rejected** for scalability reasons.

### Trade-offs Accepted

* Slight delay in delivery is acceptable.
* Chose **asynchronous queue-based broadcasting** for efficiency and server stability.

## Feature 7: Image Upload for Menu Items

### Pattern Chosen

**Asynchronous File Processing with Queue (Pub/Sub)**

### Reasoning

#### 1. Business Requirement Analysis

* Restaurants need to upload **menu item images** (2–10MB).
* Processing includes resizing, compression, and quality checks.
* Processing may take **30 seconds to 3 minutes** depending on file size.
* Restaurant managers want **upload progress** and notification when processing completes.
* Uploads may fail due to network issues or file problems.

#### 2. Technical Considerations

* Implemented using **Flask REST endpoints + Redis queue (RQ)**:

  * `POST /api/menu-images/upload` → Saves uploaded file and enqueues processing job.
  * `GET /api/menu-images/status/<image_id>` → Returns processing status and progress.
* Asynchronous processing allows large files to be handled **without blocking the main server**.
* Uses `secure_filename` to prevent unsafe file paths.
* Integrates with PostgreSQL for tracking image metadata and status.

#### 3. User Experience Impact

* Restaurants receive immediate confirmation that the file is uploaded.
* Progress updates let managers know when images are ready for publishing.
* Reduces frustration from long wait times during synchronous processing.

#### 4. Scalability Factors

* Queue-based processing scales horizontally with multiple workers.
* Handles multiple concurrent uploads without affecting other backend services.
* System can process large numbers of images reliably during peak hours.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Synchronous File Upload & Processing**

   * Pros: Simple, no queue required.
   * Cons: Blocks the request; large files cause timeouts.
   * **Rejected** due to poor UX and scalability issues.

2. **WebSockets for Status Updates**

   * Pros: Real-time progress updates.
   * Cons: Adds complexity; can be combined with queue for async processing.
   * **Rejected** for simplicity; status polling endpoint is sufficient.

### Trade-offs Accepted

* Processing is **asynchronous**, so final results are not instant.
* Chose **queue-based async processing** for scalability and reliability.
* Slight increase in infrastructure complexity (workers, Redis) is justified by efficiency and better user experience.
